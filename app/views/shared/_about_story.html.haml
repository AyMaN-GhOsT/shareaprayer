%p Share a Prayer is a simple, minimalistic way to share prayer requests and pray for others. The brainchild of #{link_to "Shane Maloy","http://shanemaloy.com/"} and #{link_to "Robert Klubenspies","http://robertklubenspies.com/"}, Share a Prayer started back in the Summer of 2010. A recent influx in interest in the project has sparked active development. The new, redesigned version of Share a Prayer features a bleeding-edge design, an account-less prayer sharing system, and a continuous feed of prayer requests from around the world. The most recent version has been open-sourced under the MIT license so that others may learn from Share a Prayer, or help support continuing development. We hope you that enjoy Share a Prayer and may God be with you in your journey.
